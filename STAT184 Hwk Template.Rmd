### Problem 15.1

```{r}
CPS85 %>%                                                             
  ggplot(aes(y = wage, x = sex )) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = sex), 
notch = TRUE,
position = position_dodge(width = 0.8),outlier.size = 1, outlier.colour = "gray") 

```

### Problem 15.2
1. The likely height among NCHS people would likey be around 1.65 meters  long.

     stat_smooth(method = lm) +
     geom_point() + 
     ylim(0,15) +
  theme(legend.position = "top") 
```
